  abstract       = {The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.},

  abstract = {Smart cities are being enabled all around the world by Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A smart city idea necessitates the integration of information and communication technologies and devices throughout a network in order to provide improved services to consumers. Because of their increasing amount and mobility, they are increasingly appealing to attackers. Therefore, several solutions, including as encryptions, authentication, availability, and data integrity, have been combined to protect IoT. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are a powerful security tool that may be improved by incorporating machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DP) techniques. This paper presents a novel intrusion detection framework for IoT-based smart environments with Ensemble Learning called IDS-SIoEL. Typically, the framework proposed an optimal anomaly detection model that uses AdaBoost, and combining different feature selection techniques Boruta, mutual information and correlation furthermore. The proposed model was evaluated on IoT-23, BoT-IoT, and Edge-IIoT datasets using the GPU. When compared to existing IDS, our approach provides good rating performance features of ACC, recall, and precision, with around 99.9\% on record detection and calculation time of 33.68 s for learning and 0.02156 s for detection.}

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) have various applications in different sectors of life, such as healthcare, agriculture, industries, transportation, smart cities, smart homes, etc., and their number is increasing with each passing day. The rapid development of IoT and its increasing demand in different fields of life create a serious problem of security for the IoT environment, which needs serious consideration to protect the IoT-enabled systems from external networks and cyber-attacks. Because of the open deployment environment and constrained resources, the IoT is prone to malicious assaults. Furthermore, the IoTâ€™s diverse and dispersed properties make it difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to keep up with current technological developments. An ML-enabled IoT-based IDS is one of the most important security methods that can assist in defending computer networks and the IoT environment from numerous attacks and malicious activities. Keeping in mind the significant contribution of ML to securing the IoT environment, we proposed an ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT networks and applications in this study. In the proposed system, we proposed a modified Random Forest (RF) algorithm and compared its performance with nine well-known ML algorithms for the detection of network attacks. Further, two of the most recent and well-known network datasets, i.e., TON-IoT and UNSW-NB15, are used to check the effectiveness of the ML-enabled IDS. The performance of the utilized ML algorithms was measured with the help of different performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, etc. The experimental outcomes illustrate the importance of the proposed ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT environment and applications. The proposed system applies to almost all of the resource-constrained devices that use the IoT network.}

  abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) technology has gained a reputation in recent years due to its ease of use and adaptability. Due to the amount of sensitive and significant data exchanged over the global Internet, intrusion detection is a challenging task in the vast IoT network. A variety of hostile behaviors and attacks are now detected by intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which are difficult or impossible for a single method to identify. An Improved Binary Golden Jackal Optimization (IBGJO) algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network are used in this paper to develop a new IDS model for IoT networks. Firstly, the GJO is improved by opposition-based learning (OBL). A binary mode of the improved GJO algorithm is used to select features from IDS data in order to determine the best subset selection. IBGJO uses OBL strategy to improve the performance of the GJO and prevents the algorithm from getting trap in local optima by controlling initial population. LSTM is used in the IBGJO-LSTM model to classify samples. Although high detection rates are achieved by machine learning techniques, the efficiency of these methods decreases with the increase in the size of the dataset. To overcome these problems, deep learning methods are more suitable for distinguishing samples from huge amount of data. The proposed model was assessed using the NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets. For CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD, the proposed model was 98.21% accurate. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed model is higher than the models BGJO-LSTM, Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm-LSTM (BWOA-LSTM) and Binary Sine Cosine Algorithm-LSTM (BSCA-LSTM). This is likely because the binary mode of the improved GJO algorithm is able to more effectively select the most relevant features from the IDS data and the LSTM is able to more accurately classify the samples. Also, the proposed model has a significantly higher percentage accuracy than Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB).}

So, in this paper, the Blockchain-based African Buffalo (BbAB) scheme with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is proposed for detecting the intrusion by enhancing security. Furthermore, normal and malware user datasets are collected and trained in the system and the dataset is encrypted using Identity Based Encryption (IBE). The encrypted data are securely stored in the blockchain in the cloud. Hereafter, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was employed to detect the intrusion in a cloud environment. African buffalo optimization was used in the RNN prediction phase for continuous monitoring of intrusion. Finally, the performance results of the developed technique are compared with other conventional models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and detection rate. The outperformance of the designed model attains better accuracy of 99.87% and high recall of 99.92%. It shows the efficiency of the designed model to protect data and security in cloud computing.}

With the increasing sophistication of cyber attack methods, traditional detection approaches are encountering more challenges. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in the field of intrusion detection due to their unique ability to capture the relationships within the graph structure of data communications. In this review, we propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes advanced research into three distinct areas: tasks related to graph construction, network design, and GNN models deployment. We detail a generalized design process for GNN-based intrusion detection models, discussing the challenges encountered at each stage. Building upon these discussions, we conduct a systematic survey of existing works. Ultimately, we delve into a thorough exploration of the future research directions and the pending issues in this domain. By adopting a problem-oriented taxonomy and conducting a targeted survey, this review aims to provide scholars with a clear, systematic framework for deepening their understanding and further exploration of the field.}

  abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has heightened the vulnerability of information security, making it susceptible to attacks that may lead to the compromise of sensitive data. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is deployed in IoT networks for the detection of attacks and to ensure the security of information. In previous works, the IDS datasets suffer from an imbalanced distribution of data about attacks and, the flow of packets in IDS which hinders the ability of deep learning models for potent and coherent classification. With the emergence of graph convolution neural network (GCN), a new sub-field of deep learning models, the structure of graphs can be leveraged to represent the data effectively. IDS datasets typically consist of flow records of data which can naturally be represented as graph structures capturing both edge features and network topology information for classification of attacks. Hence, in this paper, a novel GCN-Ensemble fusion model is proposed for enhanced IoT IDS. There are three stages in this proposed model: (1) Data processing and attribute graph generation, (2) Feature engineering and (3) Classification. The flow attributes of data packets in IDS datasets are represented as the edges and the corresponding varying attacks as nodes of the attribute graph. Here the GCN model is leveraged for feature engineering of the IDS dataset. Further, a novel Ensemble of Convolution Neural Networks is proposed for the classification task. The evaluation of the proposed model encompasses the utilization of four distinct datasets, namely BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, CIC-IDS2018, and NF UQ NIDS. In the BoT-IoT dataset, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-art models like Deep learning and Graph neural network (GNN), achieving accuracy improvements of 3.16 and 0.91%, respectively. The observed superior performance of the model in comparison to the baseline models serves to emphasize its potential to augment IoT network security.}

  abstract       = {In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.},

  abstract  = {In the face of endless cyberattacks, many researchers have proposed machine learning-based network anomaly detection technologies. Traditional statistical features of network flows are manually extracted and rely heavily on expert knowledge, while classifiers based on statistical features have a high false-positive rate. The communications between different hosts forms graphs, which contain a large number of latent features. By combining statistical features with these latent features, we can train better machine learning classifiers. Therefore, we propose a novel network anomaly detection method that can use latent features in graphs and reduce the false positive rate of anomaly detection. We convert network traffic into first-order and second-order graph. The first-order graph learns the latent features from the perspective of a single host, and the second-order graph learns the latent features from a global perspective. This feature extraction process does not require manual participation or expert knowledge. We use these features to train machine learning algorithm classifiers for detecting network anomalies. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results show that our approach allows for better learning of latent features and improved accuracy of anomaly detection. In addition, our method has the ability to detect unknown attacks.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of IoT systems, has seen them targeted by malicious third parties. To address this challenge, realistic protection and investigation countermeasures, such as network intrusion detection and network forensic systems, need to be effectively developed. For this purpose, a well-structured and representative dataset is paramount for training and validating the credibility of the systems. Although there are several network datasets, in most cases, not much information is given about the Botnet scenarios that were used. This paper proposes a new dataset, so-called Bot-IoT, which incorporates legitimate and simulated IoT network traffic, along with various types of attacks. We also present a realistic testbed environment for addressing the existing dataset drawbacks of capturing complete network information, accurate labeling, as well as recent and complex attack diversity. Finally, we evaluate the reliability of the BoT-IoT dataset using different statistical and machine learning methods for forensics purposes compared with the benchmark datasets. This work provides the baseline for allowing botnet identification across IoT-specific networks. The Bot-IoT dataset can be accessed at Bot-iot (2018) [1].}
